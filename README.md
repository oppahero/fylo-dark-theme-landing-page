- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

- Fontawesome icons

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


### What I learned

- Next image component and changing the width and height attributes
- Use of multiple fonts in Next
- Fontawesome in next

- Image management in CSS

### Useful resources
